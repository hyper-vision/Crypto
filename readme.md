Project Crypto
==================


##### Introduction

The Securitron Project is aimed at creating an easy-to-use file encryption tool using Python 2.7. The purpose of Securitron is to help the user easily create highly secure encrypted files and also decrypt them as per the user's needs. The program is designed to be deployable on any operating system running Python 2.7 and will require the PyCrypto module and the Tendo module to remain functional. Securitron may be used to encrypt a varitey of files including image files, music files, video files, PDFs, Office Documents, .exe files, .zip files, etc.

###### System Requirements:

* Any x86 or x64 based Windows, Mac or Linux.
* At least 256 MB of RAM
* Python 2.7 with required dependencies installed
* PyCrypto module and Tendo module (to prevent mutliple instances) for Linux and Mac systems.


###### Installation:

 * For Windows: The precompiled executable (.exe) can be run out of the box and requires no additional dependencies.
 
 * For Linux and Mac: The PyCrypto and Tendo modules must be installed beforehand using either pip (pip install pycrypto, pip install tendo) or easyinstall. The Securitron files may be extracted to any location on disk and run using the 'python' command (python GUI.py)
